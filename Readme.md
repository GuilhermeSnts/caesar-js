#Caesar-js

Welcome to this project.
caesar.js is my implementation of Caesar cipher on javascript.
I made it on my smartphone, and this is just for fun.

You probably know, but I need to advise you:
PLEASE, don't use it in production!

This is an open project, you can fork it, use it, and collaborate with this repository.

to use it just git clone it to your pc (or smartphone)
run: `npm install`
and run `node index.js` or ` npm run start`

You'll be asked what word you wanna cipher, type, and press enter.
Your cipher will appear on screen with pretty cyan color.

## What is Caesar's cipher?
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## What's next?

- ask the number of jumps (I'd forgotten this)
- create a npm package
- enhance the code
